          By law, Medicare must have written permission from the primary

          medical information for any purpose that isn't set out in the privacy
          notice contained in the Medicare & You handbook. The primary Medicare
          beneficiary may take back (“revoke”) their written permission at any
          time, except if Medicare has already acted based on your permission.
